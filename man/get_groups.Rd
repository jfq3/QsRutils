\usage{
get_groups(ptt.rslt, alpha = 0.05, rm.subset = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ptt.rslt}{Result from the stats function pairwise.t.test.}

\item{alpha}{Confidence level.}

\item{rm.subset}{A logical; remove group subsets if true.}
}
\value{
A list consisting of groups of treatment groups that are not significantly differnet and a matrix of p values.
}
\description{
Assign treatment groups based on pairwise t-tests.
}
\details{
This function aids in making letter assignments as to which treatments are significantly different. Also returns a square matrix of alpha values for all pairwise differences. This square matrix can serve as input to the multcompLetters function of the multcompView package which provides letter assignments.
If rm.subset is FALSE, then groups such as {A,B} and {A, B, C} may be reported. This is redundant in the sense the {A, B} is a subset of {A, B, C}. In this case if rm.subset is FALSE, the grop {A, B} is not reported.
