\title{Make Multiple Comparisons on Transformed Data}
\usage{
make_comparisons(
  expt,
  taxrank = "Phylum",
  grps = "Treatment",
  transformation = "none",
  pc.filter = 0.01,
  p.adjust.method = "BH",
  pool.sd = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expt}{Experiment level phyloseq object.}

\item{taxrank}{Rank for which to make comparisons.}

\item{grps}{Factor in sample data for which to make comparisons.}

\item{transformation}{Transformation function to use.}

\item{pc.filter}{Minimum percentage of total counts to include rank in result.}

\item{p.adjust.method}{Adjustment method for multiple comparisons.}

\item{pool.sd}{Logical, whether or not to pool standard deviations.}
}
\value{
A data frame with taxa as rows and results in columns.
}
\description{
Makes multiple comparisons of the relative abundances of taxa between treatment groups using the pairwise.t.test. Data may be transformed by a user supplied function. Three are included in this package.
}
\details{
transformation may be "none" or a user-supplied function name in quotation marks or any of the built-it transformations ("arc_sine", "log_arc_sine", or "sqrt_arc_sine"). The "sqrt_arc_sine" has generaally proven most effective.
