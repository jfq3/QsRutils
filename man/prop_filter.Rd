\title{Filter OTUs by Abundance}
\usage{
prop_filter(x, n, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A phyloseq object.}

\item{n}{Minimum percentage to keep OTU.}

\item{m}{Minimum number of samples.}
}
\value{
A logical vector of OTUs to keep.
}
\description{
Allows subsetting of a phyloseq object according to the relative abundance of OTUs in a minimal number of samples. Returns a logical vector of OTUs that are at least n\% of the sequences in at leas m samples.
}
\details{
The functions creates a logical vector to be used in subsetting a phyloseq object according to the relative abundance of OTUs in a given number of samples. For example, if n = 1 and m = 2, then the OTUs to be kept must represent at least 1\% of the sequences in at least 2 samples. The vector is then used as an argument to the phyloseq object `prune_taxa`.
